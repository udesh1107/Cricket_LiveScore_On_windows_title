This is a windows application build on .NET framework 2.0. This will read the Live socre RSS 
of  www.cricinfo.com and update the list in the GUI.Then the user can choose the cricket 
match he needs to know the live score. After choosing the cricket match my app will read 
from that particular URL and filter the Live Score. Then the Live score will be added to the 
working window title. To accomplish this I used windows API function and C# language,
I'm planning to extend this app to be used to get the Live Scores of other sports also by 
giving the users  chance to choose the sport. By using Mono cross platform I'm planning 
to develop this to be compatible with Unix and Mac OS. 
Your Ideas will be so valuable to develop this. Please feel free to contact me for any issue or 
for your suggestions. la.udesh1987@gmail.com , udesh.liyanaarachchi@gmail.com
